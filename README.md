# CambistaSim

Small playgroung for exchanging coins: USD, BRL and EUR.

## Overview
This is a C# Forms app which simulates operations of exchanging coin like a game. You receive an initial ammount of money in BRL and you can exchange between brazilian reais and dollars (BRL-USD) or euros (BRL-EUR) and the purpose is to earn money like short-term stock exchange :money:

To represent the correct price conversion, real data is used. However, dates are hiden and values are scaled so that it can make cheating harder. No other info is available, so you must learn how to make money just by following the charts. I programmed this software to have fun and learn a bit by using real data, and I discovered I am a better programmer than investor :sob: ... for now :smirk: 

## Installation
The history files are already included in the project, and the software just uses the .Net native libraries. So, by downloading VS you can already test the software. The interface looks like this:
